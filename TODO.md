Things to Do! Listed in Order of Priority

User Profile
  - clean up user profile page and be able to pull session information, i.e. display user's username 
  - allow user to create allergen profile and store information in a database, using the user_id as the foreign key (i think). ensure that the allergen information is unique for each user. 
  - allow user to reset their password (more research needs to be done on how to securely do this)
  - push error messages for logging in with incorrect/invalid credentials to the frontend

Allergen Profile
  - import menu information into the menu interface **(Y)**
  - get allergen profile to filter according to the user's preferences

Location View
  - display nearby restaurants when provided a certain radius -- this task requires us to find a database of restaurants and their coordinates. we import the .csv file, have pandas read it, and let geopy filter it

Miscellaneous
  - remedy security issues as indicated on github!
  - make it look pretty
