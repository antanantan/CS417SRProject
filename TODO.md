User Profile
  - clean up user profile page and be able to pull session information, i.e. display user's username 
  - allow user to SECURELY reset their password
  - ~~push error messages for logging in with incorrect/invalid credentials to the frontend, possibly as a flash message~~

Allergen Profile
  - import menu information into the menu interface **(Y)**
  - create allergen profile based on currently logged in user

Location View
  - display nearby restaurants when provided a certain radius -- this task requires us to find a database of restaurants and their coordinates. we import the .csv file, have pandas read it, and let geopy filter it

Miscellaneous
  - fix vue api (use "options" instead of "compositions")
