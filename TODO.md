E's Notes
  - can confirm that data is being passed upon creating an account and logging in via console log, and i changed the routing in the front and backend to transfer to the profile, but regardless of whether an account is associated or not, the website will still proceed with bringing the user to the profile page, despite exceptions being listed in the backend. i have no idea how to fix this though
  - map functionality complete! use the backend as a framework for future HTTP/Axios requests.
