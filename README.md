# CS417SRProject

Vue Router is already installed in this application.

If you are going to make adjustments, I think the only things you have to edit are in the /src and /public folders.

    /assets has aesthetics stuff, like logos and css stylesheets
    /components has the FUNCTIONAL aesthetics stuff
    /router has the code for page navigation (I think)
    /views has the actual pages (I think)

Do not touch anything else (I think)
